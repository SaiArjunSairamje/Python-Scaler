Python Libraries
***

(1) NumPy          
NumPy stands for "Numerical Python." It is a powerful library for numerical and scientific computing in Python. NumPy provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. It is the fundamental building block for many other scientific computing libraries in Python.

(2) Pandas        
Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It provides data structures like DataFrames and Series, which are designed to handle and analyze structured data, such as tabular data from spreadsheets or databases. Pandas allow you to load, clean, filter, transform, and aggregate data with ease, making it a go-to tool for data-wrangling tasks. Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

(3) Matplotlib               
Matplotlib is a plotting library in Python that allows you to create various types of static, interactive, and animated visualizations. It provides a flexible and straightforward way to generate publication-quality plots, charts, histograms, scatter plots, and more. Matplotlib is highly customizable, making it suitable for data exploration, analysis, and presentation.

(4) Seaborn      
Seaborn is a data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a higher-level interface for creating attractive statistical graphics, such as heatmaps, violin plots, pair plots, and more. Seaborn is especially useful for quickly creating visually appealing plots with minimal code, and it is often used in combination with Pandas for exploratory data analysis.

In summary, NumPy is for numerical computing, Pandas is for data manipulation and analysis, Matplotlib is for basic plotting, and Seaborn is for statistical data visualization. Together, these libraries form a powerful ecosystem for data analysis and visualization tasks in Python.
